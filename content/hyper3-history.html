                <h1>History of Exponentiation</h1>
            </div>
<p>
The story of <i>tetration</i> began with <i>exponentiation</i>.
</p>
<p>
Just shy of a score after the first records of the "+" and "&minus;" 
notation appeared in 1526, in 1544
the German mathematician <em>Michael Stifel</em> published
a detailed investigation of exponentiation in <i>Arithmetica integra</i>.
Stifel discovered <i>logarithms</i> before John Napier, and gave
an early form of logarithm tables. Stifel also coined the term
<i>exponent</i>, also published in <i>Arithmetica integra</i>, 
but it did not find its way into the English language until 1704, 
when the term <i>exponential</i> appeared in
the <i>Lexicon Technicum</i> by John Harris.

The Scottish mathematician <em>John Napier</em> is most remembered as the inventor
of <i>logarithms</i>, although the idea had been around before him, he was the 
first to use the term, although it did not appear in English until 1615. Napier 
published his major work, <i>Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio</i>, 
in 1614, which contains several dozen pages of logarithm tables, along with a 
lengthy explanation of both logarithms and trigonometry. Napier's work made a 
huge impact on natural sciences across the board.

One of the most generous contributors to the development of exponentiation was
<em>Leonhard Euler</em> (pronounced <i>oiler</i>). Euler coined the term <i>function</i>, and introduced 
the notation for trigonometric functions we still use today. Exponentiation had
already been defined over the complex numbers, for some time, when he rediscovered in 1748 what is now known as Euler's Formula:

It was later found, that Euler was not the first to discover the formula that 
now bears his name. It was first proved, in an obscure form, by <em>Roger Cotes</em> 
in 1714. Cotes is also known for working with Isaac Newton during the 
publication of his major work, <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>, commonly referred to as "<i>The Principia</i>."
