        <div class="container">
            I am currently working on making this website better. Until I can articulate tetration in a modern way that everyone can understand, you'll have to muddle through the previous versions of this website:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="archives/tetration0/index.html">Version 0</a></li>
                <li><a href="archives/tetration1/index.html">Version 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="archives/tetration2/index.html">Version 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="archives/tetration3/index.html">Version 3</a></li>
                <li><a href="index.html">Version 4</a> (current)</li>
              </ul>
        </div>
