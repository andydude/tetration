<h1>Hyper-operator Terminology</h1>
<p>
  Hyper-operators are an increasingly general class of <a href="gloss.html#
binaryoperation">binary operation</a>s that include <a href="gloss.html#
addition">addition</a>, <a href="gloss.html#
multiplication">multiplication</a>, and <a href="gloss.html#
exponentiation">exponentiation</a>. There are many different kinds of hyper-operators that have successfully spanned these three operations, but unless otherwise specified, usually the first kind are implied.
</p>
<p>
  The different kinds of hyper-operators discussed on this site are:
  <ul>
    <li><i>the</i> <em>hyper-operators</em> -- also known as:
      <ul>
        <li><em>hyperops</em> -- since it is a single short word,</li>
        <li><em>hyper-operations</em> -- since there is little distinction between an <i>operator</i> (symbol) and <i>operation</i> (function),</li>
        <li>higher hyper-operators -- since they generally produce values greater than other hyper-operators,</li>
        <li>right hyper-operators -- since they are defined by right-associative iteration (<var>x</var>(<var>x</var>(<var>x</var><var>x</var>))),</li>
        <li>the Ackermann function -- since this was defined by Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928,</li>
        <li>the Grzegorczyk hierarchy -- since this was defined by Andrzej Grzegorczyk in 1953,</li>
      </ul>
    The term <i>Ackermann function</i> is more common than <i>Grzegorczyk hierarchy</i> in English, and 
    is by far the oldest term for these hyper-operators. These hyper-operators are what you get when 
    you evaluate a repeated right-associative <a href="gloss.html#
binaryoperation">binary operation</a> starting with addition.</il>
    <br/><br/>
    <li><em>lower hyper-operators</em> -- also known as:
      <ul>
        <li>left hyper-operators -- since they are defined in terms of left-associative iteration (((<var>x</var><var>x</var>)<var>x</var>)<var>x</var>),</li>
      </ul>
    These hyper-operators generally produce values less than other hyper-operators, hence the name.
    These are what you get when you evaluate a repeated left-associative <a href="gloss.html#
binaryoperation">binary operation</a> starting with addition.
    Although <a href="gloss.html#
lower4">lower4</a> is expressible in <a href="gloss.html#
hyper3">hyper3</a>, <a href="gloss.html#
lower5">lower5</a> is not expressible 
    in standard <a href="gloss.html#
closedform">closed form</a>.</il>
    <br/><br/>
    <li><em>mixed hyper-operators</em> -- also known as:
      <ul>
        <li>Bromer hyper-operators -- since Nick Bromer wrote  about them in 1987,</li>
        <li>M&uuml;ller hyper-operators -- since Markus M&uuml;ller wrote  about them in 1993,</li>
      </ul>
    Although Bromer's notation differ from Knuth's notation, his notation seems to have influenced both 
    M&uuml;ller and Snowden , since they use his notation verbatim. None of these authors really develop 
    the theory of mixed hyper-operators, so it doesn't seem fitting to name them Bromer hyper-operators, for example.
    The nice thing about these is that they include both higher and lower hyper-operators as special cases, since
    instead of being a sequence as the first two are, mixed hyper-operators <i>form a binary tree</i>.</il>
    <br/><br/>
    <li><em>balanced hyper-operators</em> -- also known as:
      <ul>
        <li>balanced hyper-operators -- since they are balanced, and perfer neither left nor right associative iteration,</li>
        <li>centered hyper-operators -- since they generally produce values in the center of other hyper-operator values,</li>
      </ul>
    Frappier wrote an excellent article  on the iteration of <var>x</var><sup><var>x</var></sup> which is a difficult function to iterate.
    Although he only talked about the iteration of <var>x</var><sup><var>x</var></sup>, 
    he essentially paved the way for hyper-operators based on his approach, hence the name.</il>
    <br/><br/>
    <li><em>commutative hyper-operators</em> -- not well-known. 
    I suggest if you want to know more about them, read his paper about them <a href="">here</a>. As far as I understand, he defines addition and multiplication <i>on binary trees</i>, and iterates these operations instead. This is the most unique method I have seen to define hyper-operators. If only there was a conversion between binary trees and rationals...</il>
    <br/><br/>
    <li><em>exponential hyper-operators</em> -- not known before, because I invented them.
    I know it is bad style to name things after yourself in math, but this is my website, so I can do what I want! :)
    These hyper-operators are defined in such a way as to include: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, but not tetration, pentation, and so on.</il>
  </ul>

<h1>Frappier Hyper-operators</h1>
<p>
  Frappier hyper-operators are defined by the relation:
  
  
  </p><p><center><img src="img/tex/hy-frappier-def.png" alt="
  H\!F_n(x, y) = (x \mapsto H\!F_{n-1}(x, x))^{\log_2(y)}(x)
  "/></center></p><p class="noindent">
</p>
<p>
  This definition has the following consequences:
  
  
  </p><p><center><img src="img/tex/hy-frappier-enum.png" alt="
    H\!F_1(x, y) & = x + y \\\notag
    H\!F_2(x, y) & = x y \\\notag
    H\!F_3(x, y) & = x^y \\\notag
    H\!F_4(x, y) & = (x \mapsto x^x)^{\log_2(y)}(x)
  "/></center></p><p class="noindent">
</p>
<p>
  It can be shown that the zeroth Frappier hyper-operator cannot exist, because
  
  
  <img src="img/tex/hy-frappier-bad.png" alt="
  x + 1 = H\!F_1(x, 1) = (x \mapsto H\!F_0(x, x))^{0}(x) = x
  "/> by definition. Since this is a contradiction, 
  we cannot have a zeroth Frappier hyper-operator.

<h1>Robbins Hyper-operators</h1>
<p>
  Robbins hyper-operators are defined by the relation:
  
  
  </p><p><center><img src="img/tex/hy-robbins-def.png" alt="
  H\!R_n(x, y) = \exp_b H\!R_{n-1}\left( \log_b(x), \exp_b^{n-3}(y) \right)
  "/></center></p><p class="noindent">
</p>
<p>
  This definition has the following consequences (for <var>b</var> = <b><i>e</i></b>):
  
  
  </p><p><center><img src="img/tex/hy-robbins-enum.png" alt="
    H\!R_{(-1)}(x, y) & = \log^2\left(\exp^7(y) + e^{e^x}\right) \\\notag
    H\!R_0(x, y) & = \log\left(e^{e^{e^y}} + e^x\right) \\\notag
    H\!R_1(x, y) & = x + y \\\notag
    H\!R_2(x, y) & = x y \\\notag
    H\!R_3(x, y) & = x^y \\\notag
    H\!R_4(x, y) & = e^{\log(x)^{e^y}} \\\notag
    H\!R_5(x, y) & = e^{e^{\log(\log(x))^{\exp^3(y)}}}
  "/></center></p><p class="noindent">

  One of the first things to notice is that all my operators are expressible in <a href="gloss.html#
closedform">closed form</a>, unlike the the other hyper-operators. This means no hassle in their calculation, and no worries about how to write them. It also means no "new" operations. The second thing to notice is that the base <var>b</var> does not "get involved" in addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, so <em><i>any base</i></em> will <a href="gloss.html#
interpolate">interpolate</a> these three operators. Another thing of note about them is that their extension to non-integer <var>n</var> <em><i>is equivalent</i></em> to the corresponding extension of tetration! This means if we can define tetration in a logical, consistent manner, then all these operators automatically get interpolated. Once we can calculate continuously iterated exponentials, then we can express all my operators as:
  
  
  </p><p><center><img src="img/tex/hy-robbins-all.png" alt="
    H\!R_n(x, y) = \exp_b^{n-2}\left(\exp_b^{2-n}(x) \exp_b^{\binom{n-2}{2}}(y)\right)
  "/></center></p><p class="noindent">
  where the continuously <a href="gloss.html#
iteratedexponential">iterated exponential</a> would allow <var>n</var> to be real or complex.
