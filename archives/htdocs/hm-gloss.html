<h1>Welcome to the Home of Tetration</h1>
<p>
    This site is about <a href="hm-gloss.html#tetration">tetration</a>.
    Tetration is an obscure mathematical operation that
    currently falls under the category of <i>Pure Mathematics</i>, 
    because it has few <a href="appl.html">applications</a>. 
    Even so, many mathematicians
    have been interested in tetration, because of the historical significance
    of its relatives in the <a href="hm-gloss.html#hyper-operatorsequence">hyper-operator sequence</a>, 
    and because it is easy to make very large numbers with tetration.
</p>
<p>
    There are many related functions that are not exactly 
    tetration but are inter-connected in some way.
    When someone thinks about <i>sine</i> or <i>cosine</i>,
    they generally aren't the only things that come to mind. Usually
    other related functions such as <i>tangent</i> or the rest of
    the trigonometric functions also come to mind, or perhaps a
    vague memory that they have something to do with triangles.
</p>
<p>
    One function that is intimately related to tetration, that
    is much more well-known than tetration, 
    is the <a href="hm-gloss.html#lambertw-function">Lambert W-function</a>,
    also known as the <a href="hm-gloss.html#product-logarithm">product-logarithm</a>. This function allows
    many differential equations and equations involving
    exponentials to be solved in closed-form rather than having
    to resort to <a href="nmanl.html">numerical analysis</a> only. 
    The product-logarithm
    is so well known that both <i>Maple</i> (<code>LambertW</code>) and
    <i>Mathematica</i> (<code>ProductLog</code>) 
    provide it as a built-in function.
</p>
<p>
    Tetration and its associated functions have been studied for
    hundreds of years, so it has quite a <a href="hist.html">history</a>
    behind it. Most of its history has been the investigation
    of infinite tetration, also known as the 
    <a href="hm-gloss.html#infinitelyiteratedexponential">infinitely iterated exponential</a>.
    This function, along with the square <a href="hm-gloss.html#super-root">super-root</a>, are
    isomorphic to the <a href="hm-gloss.html#lambertw-function">Lambert W-function</a>, so any equation
    that one can solve can be solved by any of them.
</p>
<p>
    This website is an attempt to bring together those things
    that are related to tetration, or could possibly be of use
    in understanding more about tetration, namely various
    <a href="mthds.html">methods</a> that have been used to
    generalize <a href="itern.html">iteration</a> 
    to <em>continuous iteration</em>,
    <em>fractional iteration</em>, <em>real-analytic iteration</em>, or 
    <em>complex-analytic iteration</em> (which could also be called
    holomorphic iteration). This
    relates to tetration, because the definition (in words)
    of tetration (used here) is:
